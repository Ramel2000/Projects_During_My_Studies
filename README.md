# README

This repository contains several documents related to practical work and projects in numerical analysis and differential equation solving.

## 1. QR Decomposition, Gram-Schmidt Algorithm

This project focuses on QR decomposition using the Gram-Schmidt method, along with comparisons to other solving methods such as Cholesky, Gauss, and Householder. 
The report analyzes the performance of different methods in terms of computation time, errors, and algorithmic complexity.

## 2. Mini Project â€“ Numerical Solution of Differential Equations

This mini-project was carried out for the course on numerical solutions of differential equations. 
It covers several physical models, including integral equations, an RLC circuit, a DC motor, rocket motion, and a predator-prey model. 
For each model, the equations are solved numerically, and the results are discussed.

## 3. Gauss Method for Solving Linear Systems

This project is focused on the Gauss algorithm for solving linear systems, covering the basic versions, partial pivoting, total pivoting, and LU decomposition. 
It also includes comparisons of computation times and errors based on the size of the matrices.

## 4. Numerical Solution of Differential Equations

In this project, we tackled the numerical solution of differential equations using various numerical methods such as:
- **Explicit Euler Method**: the simplest method but the least accurate.
- **4th Order Runge-Kutta Method**: more complex but provides better results.
- **odeint Solver**: comparable to the Runge-Kutta method with similar results.
We studied the suspension of a vehicle and the stability of numerical solutions.

## 5. Iterative Methods for Solving Linear Systems

This project explores various iterative methods for solving linear systems of the form Ax = b:
- **Jacobi Method**
- **Gauss-Seidel Method**
- **Successive Over-Relaxation (SOR) Method**
The goal was to compare the efficiency of different methods in terms of errors and convergence on both randomly generated and predefined matrices.
